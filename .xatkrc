# All windows of the same application are grouped. Windows of the same
# group are binded to the keys with the same prefix. The following option
# specifies what windows should belong to the same group.

#  - Group -- group windows as window manager normally does.
#  - None -- do not group at all.

# Change window titles, so they include the corresponding shortcuts.

# What to do if the window which is to be activated is not on the
# current desktop.
# Possible values:

[RULES]
# This section specifies rules according to which window classes or names
# (titles) are transformed to abstract window names (AWNs). When a new
# window appears the program tries out the rules (from top to bottom)
# until it founds out one that matches a window property. If no
# sutable rule is found the window class will be assigned to the AWN.

# AWNs are used to determine window shortcuts.  For example, if AWN is
# 'xterm' than keybinding will more likely 'mod+x'. If it is already
# assigned to another window or is used by an another program the next
# keybinding to try out will be 'mod+t'. It sorts out the alphabetical
# characters of AWN until it finds one whose corresponding key is not
# grabbed. If it turns out there is no such a key, the window will be
# binded to any different unused key.

# Format:
# property.[regex] = [[!]awn]
# where property is title or class.

# regex matching is case insensetive. awn may contain backreferences,
# e.g. \1 is replaced with the first group of regex. If awn is omitted
# the window will not be binded to any of keys. If regex is omitted it
# implies windows without the property or with empty property. Exclamation
# mark before awn denotes that the shortcut should be permanent. Only the
# first symbol after ! is used to compose a shortcut. Permanent shortcuts
# have a higher priotity than history shortcuts and other rules, and they
# are never assigned to different windows.

# Examples:

# set awn to firefox for all the windows whose titles end with firefox
# title..*firefox$ = firefox

# remove prefix gnome- from window classes
# class.gnome-(.*) = \1

# transorm classes icecat, iceweasel, and icedove to awns cat, weasel, and
# dove respectively
# class.ice(cat|weasel|dove) = \1

# don't bind windows that don't have class property
# class. =

# always bind emacs window to 'e'
# class.emacs = !e
# title..*x-nautilus-desktop.* = zz
